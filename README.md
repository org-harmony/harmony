# HARMONY & EIFFEL
Highly Adaptable Requirements Management and Organization sYstem - HARMONY

Elicitation Interface for eFFective Language - EIFFEL

The idea is to simplify requirements elicitation using templates by supplying user's with a way to input and validate template based requirements more conveniently. The templates in mind for the system's design were by the German PARIS pattern language. This is an approach and also a research project by Prof. Dr. rer. oec. Oliver Linssen.
However, the design supports various other templates. Templates can be defined using JSON configurations, examples for already designed templates can be found in docs/templates/. Also, further documentation will explain how templates can be created using the already existing configuration files as examples.

HARMONY will further be extended to suit more (hopefully someday all) needs of the requirements engineering.
Join us during this journey, no matter if you're a contributor, user or just watching!

The project and everybody involved in it is looking forward for your feedback, as we continuously strive to improve HARMONY and EIFFEL. The project is still under active development.
