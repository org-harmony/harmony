# HARMONY
Highly Adaptable Requirements Management and Organization sYstem - HARMONY

HARMONY is a requirements management and organization tool. The adaptibility will be implemented through various concepts. One of them being modules, similar to the way Caddy leverages extensibility in Go projects.
The early versions of HARMONY will only support an elicitation companion through one of the core modules of HARMONY: Elicitation Interface for eFFective Language (EIFFEL).
